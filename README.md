# DaBS
By using the DB Ontology and other knowledge models, create a Web tool able to compare, run, visualize, and recommend various database management systems (DBMS) according to developer preferences and specific usages – e.g., implementing financial desktop applications, e-commerce Web applications, educational platforms, document management systems, etc. The tool will support various paradigms (relational, graph-based, key-value, tree-like,...), query languages (SQL, GQL, SPARQL, GraphQL, XQuery), platforms (servers) + running environments (desktop, Web, cloud), specific contexts – i.e. focusing on optimizing queries, redundancy, security, performance, schema versus schema-less approaches, programming languages/paradigms, and others.
