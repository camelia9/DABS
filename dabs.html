                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    DABS - Database Smart Web Tool is a Web tool able to compare, run,
                    visualize, and recommend various database management systems (DBMS)
                    according to developer preferences and specific usages – e.g., implementing 
                    financial desktop applications, e-commerce Web applications, educational platforms, 
                    document management systems or others.
                </p>
                <p>We wish to develop a smart platform which will be able to provide an innovative mean to find the most suitable solutions for project developing,
                    in order to be up to date with the cutting edge database technologies. Our secondary goal is to facilitate the process through which our users can learn new skills regarding databases usage methods. All of the provided functionalities
                    are presented in a user-friendly maner through a web interface, whilst offerint a powerful tool not only for experienced developers but also for rookies.
                 </p>
            </section>
    
            <section typeof="sa:Results" id="definition">
                    <h2>Architecture</h2>
                    <p>
                         In the first section we briefly described the main goals of the application. The architecture has two main components: 
                         a front-end part, for the client interaction, built over Angular Material JS framework and a back-end component implemented in NodeJs, designed following a few well known paradigms and hosted by using various resources provided by the AWS Cloud Platform. These two components will communicate over the HTTP protocol, using the JSON and its extension JSON-LD as the established data exchange format. The client will build JSON requests to send requests toward the backend component, while the received responses will be in the JSON-LD format. In the frontend implementation, we'll have a module for JSON-LD to HTML+RDFa, in order to have semantic data encoded right in our single page application.  
                    </p>
                    <p>The web services conglomerate provides a variety of functionalities, such as getting a news feed list containg the 
                        latest news in the world of databases, finding the most suitable datase for certain kinds of projects, a playground for 
                        multiple database solutions and the visualization of our user's preferences relatively to our apps proposed technologies. An advantage to the proposed architecture is that each and every functionality is independent to the other, therefore our application will not be fully affected if a downtime were to occur in one of the given components. More details about each component's particular behaviour can be seen in the corresponding sections from below.
                    </p>

                <section id="back-end">
                        <h3>Back-end Component</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Back-end Component Architecture is built over two main paradigms: 'REST' and 'Serverless'.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                                <li><p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest">REST</a> or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. 
                                    REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.</p></li>
                                <li><p><a href="https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/what-is-serverless.html">Serverless</a> computing (or serverless for short), is an execution model where the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) is responsible for executing a piece of code by dynamically allocating the resources. 
                                    And only charging for the amount of resources used to run the code. 
                                    The code is typically run inside stateless containers that can be triggered by a variety of events including http requests, database events, queuing services, monitoring alerts, file uploads, scheduled events (cron jobs), etc. The code that is sent to the cloud provider for execution is usually in the form of a function. 
                                    Hence serverless is sometimes referred to as “Functions as a Service” or “FaaS”.</p></li>      
                            
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            This module is composed of the following components:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS Api Gateway</a> - Its role is to aggregate the lambda functions cluster and to secure a unique point of access to all functionalities for the web client to call. From the gateway, the request can go two ways: either to the authentication lambda (if the user is not logged in, therefore he does not have a JWT token) or to the authorization lambda (if the user has a JWT token and therefore is already authenticated).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Authentication Lambda</a> - Its purpose is to fullfil the process of logging in for users that want to use our services. In the SignIn View of our application, the user can select either to login with one of his social media accounts or to log in with an account from our system. This option is sent towards this lambda, which will verify the provided details either by consulting an API from Google, Facebook or Twitter or by searching the user + hash password combination using the SparQL Query Runner Endpoint on the users dabatase from our GraphDB instance. If the login process is successful, a JWT will be returned to user in the frontend application, which will be stored in cookies for further usage when sending the requests. If the login process fails, a HTTP specific error code will be returned alongside with an error message.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Authorization Lambda</a> - This service provides the authorization step that allows the user access to the functionalities enclosed in the other lambdas. When a request is received through the API Gateway, it will first arrive here, where the provided JWT token is validated by searching if there is an active session associated to the IP + JWT + user_id combination. If the token does not exist or it is expired, an error response is sent back to the user. If the authorization is successfull, the request is forwarded to the lambda that handles the requested functionality.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB Host</a> - In this host we have a database for the active user sessions, which will contain the IP + JWT + user_id pairs; This will be used in the Authentication Lambda to insert an active session for the logged in user and will be further consulted by the Authorization Lambda to validate the authenticity of the JWT token. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">User Lambda</a> - This lambda exposes functionalities for the user entity manipulations, such as adding an user to the RDF data store, updating one or deleting one. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Preferences Lambda</a> - This lambda exposes functionalities for the user's preferences entity manipulations, such as adding a preference to the RDF data store, updating one or deleting one. It is also used for retrieving all preferences. The responses from this endpoint are in JSON-LD format for entity related functionalities.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Database Lambda</a> - This lambda exposes functionalities for the databse entity manipulations, such as adding a new database to the RDF data store, updating one or deleting one. It is also used for retrieving all databases. Furthermore, this lambda is used for gaining access to the database playground cluster that allows the user to try different technologies, such as Mongo, Redis and PostgreSQL. The responses from this endpoint are in JSON-LD format for entity related functionalities, while the others are in plain JSON.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">News Feed Lambda</a> - This lambda allows the retrieval of the latest news about databases. It uses DbWeekly as a data source, which can be integrated in the application using tefter.io. The responses from this endpoint are in plain JSON.  
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SparQL Query Runner Endpoint</a> - This component is in charge of transforming the received parameters in lambdas (through requests) in various SparQL queries, depending on which data source we need to interogate. Once the response is received in the lambda from GraphDB, it will be sent as JSON-LD back to the client. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="https://dbdb.io/">Database Playground</a> - It is composed of one Redis instance, one PostgreSQL instance and one MongoDB instance, all deployed in AWS, eventually on a dedicated VM. They will be queried directly by the Database Lambda when someone sends a query.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="http://graphdb.ontotext.com">GraphDB Host</a> - It is used to store the RDF data for our three main entities: Users, Databases and Preferences. It will be queried from the SparQL Query Runner Endpoint.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>  
                            As a summary, the Lambda functions offer the main functionalities, being the core elements of our architecture.
                            They are aggregated via an API Gateway, which oferrs an unique point of access for the web client. Some of the lambda functions communicate with data sources represented as ontologies for databases, users and preferences stored in a RDF repository (GraphDB).
                            The query language for accessing the datasources is SparQL and the communication contract established between the client and the services provider is a 
                            mix between JSON (used for request) and JSON-LD (sent through responses).
                            The resource access is made securely via a midway security lambda that ensures all the API calls have to be from logged users. The way to interact with the API can be seen in the API specification from our <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/DABS/wade.dabs/1.0.0-oas3"> SwaggerHub Project</a>.

                <section id="front-end">
                        <h3>Front-end Component</h3>
                        
                        <p>The user interface will be created using the AngularJS framework combined with Material Design, which is ideal for building single-page applications. AngularJS Material is an implementation of Google's Material Design Specification (2014-2017). This project provides a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components for AngularJS developers. The web interface will be hosted in AWS S3 Bucket, in order to communicate easily with the other components of the project. The data which is used to populate the web page in specific context is received either in the JSON format or its extension JSON-LD. For the latter, we'll use a parser to transform it in HTML+RDFa format, which will be loaded into the page using custom built AngularJS directives. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the following figure, right side, we can see the sign in page, which will be the first view an user sees. There are two main options to authenticate in the application: either login with an account created in our application or log in with a social media account. The log-in step is necessary because we want to be able to gather data about the user preferences in order to build some statistics on various periods of time and to know which technologies may be suited for each and every user. If the user does not have an account, nor does he want to log in with social media, there is a create account section, which can be seen in the left side of the picture. It requires some simple information, such as email, password and name. Once the user authenticates successfully in our application a JWT token is generated for the current session. The JWT should be passed along with each subsequent request in order to fullfil the auhtorization process for the backend functionalities.
                        </p>

                            In the next figure, we can see the Home View, where we first present the current trends in database searches for the past week. This graphic's data
                            is computed using our user's past queries and preferences and the technology recommendations they resulted in (gathered from his inputs in the Recommendation Wizard). The second chart analyses the our users past queries based on different criteria such as searches paradigms, running environments,
                            types of databases and so on ans so forth. It should highlight the most searched values in order to help the user gain insight over what is trending right now. The second part of this page is composed of a newsfeed with the most recent information gathered from DBWeekly. The user is able to share this
                            information through his social media account (if he is logged in with one) or send it through email (if he is logged in with an application specific account). There is also an option to view the original source, should he want to look into similar older articles. The main navigation menu is available in the upper right side of the page. It allows us to switch between the dynamic views of our single page application. In the left upper corner, there is a small menu which allows the user to log out of the application or switch to a view with his accounts data and settings. 
                        </p>

                        In the Recommendation Tool View the user is able to select values for the various filtering criteria available. Once the values have been selected, the user can submit his search. Below he can see the top three search results that match his criteria, alongside with the available RDFa information and a knowledge graph (for each result) that ties each search result to other types of databases that may be similar in some ways.

                        In the Database Playground module, the user is able to select a database type from one of the three available options: MongoDB (Document Based), Redis( Key/Value Store) and PostgreSQL. After selecting a database, a shell will be spawned, which will allow the user to run certain queries on each database. First, he should make the setup for the database (such as creating a database, a table/collection, maybe define a schema) and then he can perform queries. Every operation is sent to the backend component and processed during the user's session. The responses to the operations (received from backend) will be shown to the user in this shell. Once the session has ended, the database the user created will be dropped, in order to keep a clean and available playground for all users.

                            The main storage solution used for the above presented graph is the RDF solution GraphDB. Each entity in the graph is interconnected with others by using properties and relationships. Each entity is described in the tables below.
                            By using the ontology / RDF concepts, Dabs is able to suggest entities in a smart way, based on the relationships between instances. For instance, upon requesting a database by selecting values for some properties, we are able to use the interlinked data from the RDF storage for searching based on past queries of this user and the provided options.

                                The use case routes are color coded to emphasize the different ways in which
                                a user can interact with our application. Red corresponds to the authentication step, blue corresponds to getting the news feed flow, yellow point to the search for databases recommandations, while green is for viewing preferences and orange for the database solutions playground.

                           To sum up, this solution can be a valuable tool for any developer who is in search for trending technologies that are the most suited for his end goal. It also provides an intuitive web UI which allows the user to explore all of the applications features. Furthermore, all functionalities can be queried through an API (without actually needing the client), since we have a decoupled and distributed architecture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As for the future work, we propose enriching the available data sources for querying technologies, allowing access for a few more technologies in the playground and extending the social media handles integration to the point where users can share between eachother interesting choices of databases and rate the quality of our recommandations in order to improve with each and every query.
                        </p>
