    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document represents a user guide on how to take full advantage of the Dabs Project features and capabilities.
      If you are a developer, you may want to check the technical guide we have here: <a
      href="https://camelia9.github.io/dabs">https://camelia9.github.io/dabs</a>.
      If you simply want to understand the way our web application can be used, proceed to the following sections, which
      have detailed presentations
      for each page the user may end up interacting with. Make sure you have a running browser installed on your
      computer
      (Firefox, Safari, Chrome etc.) and
      access the following link: <a href="http://ec2-54-93-236-36.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:4200/">http://ec2-54-93-236-36.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:4200/</a>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section typeof="sa:Results" id="login">
    <h2>Login View</h2>
    <p>Once you accessed the given link, you should end up on the page presented in the following picture.</p>
    <figure typeof="sa:Image">

      <figcaption>
        <center>Login Page</center>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The Login page contains two simple inputs, one for your email and one for your password. Once you complete them,
      you can press the Sign In button, which will take you towards the Home page.
      In case you do not already have an account, on the page is also a hyperlink towards the sign up page, which can be
      seen under the "Don't have an account?" text.
      Clicking on "Create one now" will take you to the Sign Up page.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="sign-up">
    <h2>Sign Up View</h2>
    <p>The Sign up page has four simple inputs. The first input is the name, the second one is your email (which will be
      used for authentication),
      while the third and the fourth one are password fields. If the password fields do not match, you will not be
      allowed
      to create the account.
      Once you completed the fields, you can press the Sign Up button. If the process is successful, you should be
      redirected back towards the login page.</p>

  <section id="home">
    <h2>Home Page</h2>
    <figure typeof="sa:Image">

      <figcaption>
        <center>Home Page</center>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>After reaching the home page, you will see two sections, one that presents some statistics about database trends
      and usages, while the second section represents a newsfeed that brings our users the latest news in the database
      development and innovation world. The first graphic's data represents the most trending databases based on user
      searches. The second graphic presents the most popular programming languages in respect to the database searches
      performed by our users. These charts should highlight the most searched values in order to help the user
      gain insight over what is trending right now. The newsfeed contains several cards with news, a short description
      and an open button in case the user wishes to read the full article from his source.
      From this page you can either access your account information from the right upper corner of the interface or log
      out by clicking the button next to the account pictogram. You can also access the main menu of the app by clicking
      in the left upper corner on the three-lined pictogram. From the main menu you can navigate towards the
      Recommandation Tool or towards the Playground feature by clicking on the items in menu.</p>

  <section id="recommendation">
    <h2>Recommendation Page</h2>
    <p>In this page we can see the Preference Wizard, your especially designed tool that allows the easy filtering of
      database technologies. You are first greeted with a form. There are multiple filters that
      can be selected in order to perform a query. If no filter is provided (a value other than None), an error message
      will be displayed. Once you have chosen values for one or more inputs, you can click the submit button. After
      that, under the form we will display the results of the queries as a paginated ordered list. You can click on more
      items in the list to see detailed information about a item. Once expanding a database from the list, there is also
      a button called "View Graph" that allows the visualization of the database, its properties and other related
      databases, when clicking on each property.</p>

  <section id="playground">
    <h2>Playground Page</h2>
    <p>This page is designed to allow the user to try some database technologies live, directly in the browser, without
    needing any other technology.
    Once you reach this page (from the menu), you have a dropdown in the left corner, from where you can select the
    type of database you want to play with. The shell will be refreshed each time you change the database type you want
    to play with. After that, you can start by writing help in the shell, in order to familiarize yourself with the
      allowed commands for that database type.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="account">
    <h2>Account Page</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this page is to allow users to easily manage their account data.
    In this page, there are two sections. One for updating and one for deleting data. The update section allows you to
    update your email, your password or your name. At least one of the fields should be filled in order for the update
    to work. In order to get to the next field, you can click the Next button. In order to go back to a formerly
    completed field, you can click the Back button. Pressing the Reset button will result in the deletion of all
    completed fields.
    For the delete account section, pressing the delete button will result in your account and all the associated data
      to be erased from our system. Following, you will be redirected to the login page.</p>

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      This solution can be a valuable tool for any developer who is in search for trending technologies that
      are the most suited for his end goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the future work, we propose enriching the available data sources for querying technologies, allowing access
      for a few more technologies in the playground and integrating social media handles to the point
      where users can share between eachother interesting choices of databases and rate the quality of our
      recommendations in order to improve with each and every query.
